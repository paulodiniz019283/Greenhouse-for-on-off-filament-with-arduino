# Greenhouse-for-on-off-filament-with-arduino
This project was carried out in partnership with Victor Alisson and Washington Henrique.  Humidity in the Amazon region reaches averages of 77% to 91%, making the use of plant-based filaments that are used for 3D printing have a short shelf life. Given this, this project comes with the purpose of reducing humidity in a controlled environment to conserve these materials. The materials used in this project were.  1 x Arduino Mega; 1 x Relay module; 1 x Styrofoam Box; 1 x Liquid Crystal Display; 1 x Potentiometer; 1 x DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor;
