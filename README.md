# Greenhouse-for-on-off-filament-with-arduino
This project was carried out in partnership with Victor Alisson and Washington Henrique.  

Humidity in the Amazon region reaches averages of 77% to 91%, making the use of plant-based filaments that are used for 3D printing have a short shelf life. Given this, this project comes with the purpose of reducing humidity in a controlled environment to conserve these materials.

The materials used in this project were:  
1 x Arduino Mega; 

1 x Relay module; 

1 x Styrofoam Box; 

1 x Liquid Crystal Display; 

1 x Potentiometer; 

1 x DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor;

1x Incandescent lamp;
